    "1. Exponential growth in the data (~2011/2012 year)\n",
    "    - people started using smartphones, social media platform, youtube leding to data generation in huge \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deep learning models \n",
    "    - higher accuracy\n",
    "    - In the older machine learning algorithms, as the amount of data increased, after some specific point, performance became constant\n",
    "    - however, deep learning models showed increase in performance with increase in amount of data because of deep neural networks\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Technology upgradation (cheap hardware)\n",
    "    - Now, we have cheap harwares like Nvidia GPUs which help in training the models\n",
